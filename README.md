# Minesweeper
Minesweeper game
## Description
Minesweeper is a classic puzzle game where players uncover cells on a grid while avoiding mines. Each cell either contains a mine or a number indicating the number of adjacent cells containing mines. The goal is to uncover all safe cells without detonating any mines.
## Background
In Minesweeper, each cell on the grid can either be a mine or safe. A safe cell reveals a number indicating the count of neighboring cells that contain mines. Based on this information, the AI will construct logical sentences representing its knowledge about the game board. These sentences consist of sets of cells and their corresponding mine counts.
